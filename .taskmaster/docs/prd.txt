Conversational Résumé Screener (Idea #2)
• Core demo: upload a PDF résumé and ask “what should I improve?”; agent speaks actionable feedback.
• Stack: File upload + pdf.js → GPT résumé-review prompt → speech-synthesis.
• Memory: persist last versions & feedback in IndexedDB.

Example interaction — Conversational Résumé Screener

Step 0: user drags a PDF résumé into the web page (no traditional UI beyond a single drop-zone).

Agent (speech):
“Résumé received. Hi Ananya, what aspect would you like feedback on first?”

User (voice):
“Focus on improving my summary statement.”

Agent:
“Your current summary reads: ‘Dedicated software engineer with experience in full-stack development.’ It’s vague. Try:
‘Full-stack engineer with 3+ years building React and Node.js products used by 200 k+ customers; passionate about performance and accessibility.’
Shall I insert that for you?”

User:
“Yes, replace it.”

Agent:
“Done. Anything else?”

User:
“Are there redundant keywords?”

Agent:
“I see ‘team player’ and ‘hard-working’ repeated in both skills and experience sections. These filler phrases add no value. Recommend deleting them and emphasizing quantifiable impact instead. Want me to highlight the lines?”

User:
“Highlight, please.”

Agent:
“I’ve marked the two lines in yellow. Let me know when you’re ready for a fresh PDF.”

User:
“Generate the updated PDF.”

Agent:
“New résumé exported. I’ve saved the before-and-after versions in your drafts folder. Good luck with your applications!”
